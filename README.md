# LancerScoutLib

This library is intended to be a group of utilities for FRC Robotics scouting app development (I think it's compatible with FTC as well) for team 321 RoboLancers. 

To any future Lancers, if the documentation isn't enough or you want any help, feel free to reach out to me at endershadowz122@gmail.com. 

Feel free to fork or make changes! This library is simple and by no means perfect, and any help would be great.
